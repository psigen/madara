 *
 * One of the features that sets MADARA apart from other key-value stores
 * and NoSQL databases is packet aggregation. MADARA KaRL logics are evaluated
 * atomically and the modified variables are grouped together in a packet that
 * is clock-stamped and sent to other agents in the network. In this tutorial,
 * we showcase what packet aggregation is with a simple tracking application.
 *
 * This tutorial is an extension of the counting_agents tutorial but adds
 * location information and vector
 * 
 * Windows:
 *   cd %MADARA_ROOT%\bin
 *   tutorial_packet_aggregation 0 (in one terminal)
 *   tutorial_packet_aggregation 1 (in a second terminal)
 *   tutorial_packet_aggregation 2 (in a third terminal)
 *   etc.
 *
 * Linux:
 *   cd $MADARA_ROOT/bin
 *   tutorial_packet_aggregation 0 (in one terminal)
 *   tutorial_packet_aggregation 1 (in a second terminal)
 *   tutorial_packet_aggregation 2 (in a third terminal)
