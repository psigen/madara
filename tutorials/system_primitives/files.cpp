 * This file contains a simple file reading application
 * that prompts a user for a file and then reads the file into
 * the knowledge base before printing the file size and type.

  /**
   * Create a default knowledge base. If we wanted to share the file,
   * we would need to pass the knowledge base a networking transport.
   * To see an example of this, look at the tutorial on distributed
   * knowledge. The counting_agents.cpp file is a good start.

  std::string my_file;

  /**
   * Read the file into the .file variable in the knowledge base. Note that
   * if you make a distributed application and want to transfer the file to
   * all agents on the network transport, you'll want to change the variable
   * to a global one by removing the period. A period in front of a variable
   * name means that the variable is local information only.
   *
   * We can also use the system call #read_file to read a file into the engine
   * within a KaRL logic. Similarly, we could call #write_file from within
   * a logic to write a variable to a file. See #print_system_calls () for
   * a listing of all available system calls. Alternatively, you can run
   * system_calls from MADARA_ROOT/bin.
