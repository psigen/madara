  /**
   * This tutorial has showcased a rather silly example, but it is enough
   * information to implement your own reinforcement learning. Reinforcement
   * learning is a continuous process involving multi-valued logic which
   * attempts to satisfy internals rules according to rewards and penalties.
   * To make your own reinforcement learning agent, think of formulating a
   * problem like this:
   *
   * 1) Do I have sensors? What are they returning? What is the utility of
   *    a sensor returning something good? What happens if the sensor is
   *    wrong? Does it decrease overall good (i.e., should I give myself
   *    a penalty to indicate that I'm not contributing as much as I should
   *    toward being a part of the agent community?)
   * 2) What is the goal of the agent community? Are they collaborative or
   *    competitive? This will help establish rewards and penalties.
   * 3) Generally, the more positive the variable, the higher the utility.
   *    However, as we can see in the above example, too much hoarding of
   *    utility could be a bad thing. Consider an agent community that
   *    governs roads. One road agent collects 90% of the tolls and keeps
   *    all of the money to himself for maintenance. This means the other
   *    roads all become neglected and potentially impassible, resulting
   *    in overall city throughput of vehicles to go down. The reinforcement
   *    learning should be tweaked to have either a maximum cash-on-hand
   *    before dumping it into the public coffers for road maintenance or
   *    use KaRL to announce each agent's cash-on-hand and when some
   *    threshold or percentage of overall wealth is met, dump excess
   *    into the road agent who needs the cash the most. In this way,
   *    you can create a harmonious agent system based on reinforcement
   *    learning. See the tutorials in distributed_knowledge for more
   *    information on how you can update each agent using variable mutations.
