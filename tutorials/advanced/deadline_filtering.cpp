 * @file deadline_filtering.cpp
 * @author James Edmondson <jedmondson@gmail.com>
 *
 * This file contains a simple distributed application that sends messages
 * and enforces deadlines on the receiver side. To induce deadline infractions,
 * the receiver receives a couple of messages and then sleeps for 10s. It keeps
 * track of the number of messages that were received within deadline and
 * out-of-deadline and prints them at the end.
 * 
 * Windows:
 *   cd %MADARA_ROOT%\bin
 *   tutorial_deadline_filtering 0 (in one terminal)
 *   tutorial_deadline_filtering 1 (in a second terminal)
 *   etc.
 *
 * Linux:
 *   cd $MADARA_ROOT/bin
 *   tutorial_deadline_filtering 0 (in one terminal)

/**
 * Filter for checking deadlines on sent messages.
 *
 * Filters in MADARA are essentially external function calls that have the
 * opportunity to augment the first argument passed into the function. MADARA
 * will provide other arguments to the filter, to help provide the developer
 * with context concerning the transport layer (which may impact decisions
 * made during filtering).
 *
 * The arguments passed to the filter are the following:
 *
 * args[0] : The knowledge record that the filter is acting upon
 * args[1] : The name of the knowledge record, if applicable ("" if unnamed)
 * args[2] : The type of operation calling the filter (integer valued).
 *         : IDLE_OPERATION (should never see)
 *         : SENDING_OPERATION (transport is about to send the record)
 *         : RECEIVING_OPERATION (transport has received the record and is
 *         :                      about to apply the update)
 *         : REBROADCASTING_OPERATION (transport is about to rebroadcast the
 *                                     record -- only happens if rebroadcast
 *                                     is enabled in Transport Settings)
 * args[3] : Bandwidth used while sending through this transport
 * args[4] : Bandwidth used while receiving from this transport
 * args[5] : Message timestamp (when the message was originally sent)
 * args[6] : Current timestamp (the result of time (NULL))
 * args[7] : domain (partition of knowledge updates)
 * 
 * These args are modifiable in the understanding that future arguments may be
 * communication channels back to the transport to inform some higher level
 * instruction (e.g., discard the entire packet, turn off rebroadcasting, etc.)
 * This is currently unimplemented but planned.
 *
 * Madara::Knowledge_Engine::Variables is a hook into the knowledge base that
 * allows for querying or setting knowledge not available in the args list.
 * Variables can be used for communicating with other filters or the main logic
 * of the agent.
