INTRODUCTION

This directory contains scripts to generate Debian packages for 64-bit and
32-bit Linux. The scripts are actually mostly identical, except for default
options that may be passed in by command line. If you have any questions
about the command line arguments, please pass -h to the script for information.

NOTES

* You will need sudo access to use these scripts. Packages are required to be
  installed for Debian package building.
* Please see the help (-h) for information on how to define the ACE version you
  are using. This version number dictates the shared object version number that
  is generated.
