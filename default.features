/// Enable this feature if you would like to build the 
/// KaRL Automated Testing System
kats                    = 0

/// @feature ndds
/// Enable this feature if you would like to generate NDDS Transports
ndds                    = 0

/// @feature null_lock
/// Enable this feature if you want to only use NULL locks instead of recursive
/// locks. This is a very dangerous feature for novices and should only be done
/// if you understand the ramifications of having a lock-free database and if
/// it is appropriate for your applications. It will be a performance boost,
/// of course, but it is almost unfathomable to enable this unless some kind
/// of external locking mechanism is used at the appropriate time inside of
/// a custom network transport (especially a read thread) and around knowledge
/// accessor methods like get, set, and any MADARA container methods.
